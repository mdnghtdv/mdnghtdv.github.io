### On May 16, our application turned 10 years old!

It was we who came up with the abbreviation WTMP ten years ago, which is now used not only by us, but also by our competitors.

They don't want to come up with an idea for their app, so they steal the idea, name and icon.
But they wonâ€™t succeed because they donâ€™t have you â€“ our users. You are the best! 

Thank you for a remarkable ten years. Your support has been essential to our journey. 
We look forward to continuing our shared adventure.

Warm regards, Your WTMP Team ðŸ¤—
